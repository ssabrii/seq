**Seq** â€” a language for bioinformatics
=======================================

Seq is a programming language for computational genomics and bioinformatics. With a Python-compatible syntax and a host of domain-specific features and optimizations, Seq makes writing high-performance genomics software as easy as writing Python code, and achieves performance comparable to (and in many cases better than) C/C++.

Source code is available `on GitHub <https://github.com/seq-lang/seq>`_. You can also learn more about Seq from `our paper <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3360551>`_ or by visiting our `Gitter chatroom <https://gitter.im/seq-lang/Seq?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link>`_.
